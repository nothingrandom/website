					<h4>Hex colors</h4>
					<p>The first part of the project was simply grabbing the time in a number format, displying it, and changing the background of the page to match the 6 digit time string. Doing this was extremely easy. It was just a case of grabbing the 3 sets of time information, and putting them togeher to create a hex value.</p>

					<h4>Fuzzy clock</h4>
					<p>The most prominent feature of the clock is the fuzzy time read out. Unsurprisingly, this was quite a challenge to code as it involved "reading" the current time and working out what it meant to then display the data in text format. I learnt quite a bit from this half of the project, and used large amounts of the JS language that I previously had no experience with.</p>
