					<h4>The Brief</h4>
					<p><span class="italic">&quot;This month weâ€™d like you to design a website for a visual artist. Artists typically want their site to display their work, communicate information about upcoming exhibitions, sell prints and/or books, carry a bio/about page, a media appearances or news page, and sometimes a blog.&quot;</span></p>

					<h4>The Concept</h4>
					<p>I wanted the website to focus on the artist, and their artwork with minimum distraction. I decided that I should make full usage of the screen to display both information about the artist and wide images. I also wanted to optimize for a smaller screen, so that they don't miss out on the experience. After deciding to display large pictures of each piece of work, I also made the choice to display information about the piece when the image is hovered over. This allows a certain element of elegance to exist on the website, which further adds to the creativity of the artist.</p>

					<h4>The Launch</h4>
					<p>After the design concept had been published in <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine">issue 252</a>, I proceed to turn it into a working website. I launched the <a href="http://scottpatience.co.uk">finished website</a> a couple of months later, with a few tweaks to how it looked and worked.</p>
