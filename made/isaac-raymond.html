						<h4>The Design</h4>
						<p>From an early stage of the project I knew that I wanted to display two large images on either side of a central navigation bar. This further developed into the idea of having either side being <a href="https://github.com/nothingrandom/background-slideshow.js">a slideshow</a>, so that the maximum number of images were shown while maintaining full usage of the screen. I also knew that I wanted to use a Twitter feed, as a way of Isaac keeping people up to date. On the original concept, the idea was to have the events displayed on the home page as well, but I soon discovered that this made it look crowded, so the events got their own page.</p>

					<h4>Mobile optimization</h4>
					<p>The aim of the mobile site was to make the website load as quickly as possible without users loosing any of the features from the desktop site. The navigation moved to the top of the page, and the two slideshow panels became one. The Twitter feed was relocated to the contact page, so that the page could load faster.</p>

					<h4>Launching the site</h4>
					<p>We launched the website over an open WiFi network at Costa Coffee in Brighton. This was, in summary, the worst idea I'd ever had, but it gave me a new found appreciation for the snappy website speed.</p>
					<p>After the launch of the site, Isaac was quick to publicize it, and it was received with many compliments. The website has continued to receive a steady flow of traffic from around the world on multiple devices.</p>
