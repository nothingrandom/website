					<h4>The Design</h4>
					<p>The project design started off as a relatively simple website. I decided that only a one page website was required, and worked out the best way to display the information. I split the information into three primary sections, and designed them all slightly differently while maintaining an overall design. </p>

					<h4>Color scheme and fonts</h4>
					<p>The color pallet I used is composed of a range of blue and grey hues. This helps to draw attention towards the website content. Both the fonts that I used are available for free, and are quite different from each other. This is so that they are easily distinguishable on both the website and on print.</p>

					<h4>The development</h4>
					<p>After development on the website started, I realized that I needed to add something to make the website stand out more. So I wrote a script to give sections of the website a <a href="https://github.com/nothingrandom/parallax.js">parallax effect</a>. I also wrote a script to make the <a href="https://github.com/nothingrandom/stickyheader.js">header &quot;sticky&quot;</a>.</p>

					<h4>Making it mobile</h4>
					<p>The mobile site was easy to implement. As the images are rather minimal and there is only one page, not a lot of optimization was required in order to get the site to load quickly. The website has been viewed on multiple devices with a range of different internet speeds, so spending a little bit of extra time on the mobile website was worthwhile.</p>
