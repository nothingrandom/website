					<h2>Computers are a part of life</h2>
					<p>Computers are a massive part of daily life. It is estimated that between 70&#37; and 80&#37; of the world population has some form of access to a computer. If you take that with a pinch of salt, that means that 5.5 billion people have access to a computer. But in today's world access to technology isn't just found in the standard desktop computer. You have mobile phones and tablets. Even general kitchen appliances are now fitted with computer chips. It is said that a modern day washing machine has more computing power than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">Apollo 11</a>. The world has come to depend on computers, and looking at a modern day perspective on computing knowledge, that is a scary thought.</p>
					<p>If you give a young child a tablet, they know how to use it. If you give them a book or magazine, they are clueless. They are called digital natives, but how much do they really know?</p>

					<h2>The people making the changes today</h2>
					<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dark-side-of-social-media-age-discrimination/">Estimations say that</a> the average age of a Facebook employee is 26, and a Google employee is 31. Apple's average employee age is 33, and for IMB and HP it is 44.</p>
					<p>These figures are both good and bad. It shows that there is a wide range of age in employees for the large tech companies, but if you really think about it, 44 is a relatively high average age compared to the low of 26 from Facebook. In general though, there is a wide range of age diversity across the work place.</p>

					<h2>A quick look at the current market for computing jobs</h2>
					<p>With computing becoming increasingly popular in everyday life there has been a growth in demand for computer employees, but at the same time this growth in demand has just turned into vacancies. A demand which exists but without anyone to fill it. A surprising reality as the wage for a C&#35; developer is around &#x0024;65,000 &#40;&pound;40,000&#41;, and for a Java developer around &#x0024;77,000 &#40;&pound;47,000&#41;.</p>
					<p>A lack of employees in such a digital age is confusing, why aren't there more young people wanting to program?</p>

					<h2>What the generation of children are being brought up with</h2>
					<p>From an early age a child will know how to use a smart phone or tablet before they know how to turn a page of a book.</p>

					<p>This child is called a digital native, and she isn't the only one. All across the country there are children classified as digital natives, from her age and up.</p>
					<p>The reason why none of them are interesting in code and programming? One possible reason is the fact that they take technology for granted. Having technology around them is natural, they expect it. They also expect it to work. And when it stops working, they have no idea how to fix the problem.</p>
					<p>In the average school in the UK the ICT &#40;Information and Communication Technology&#41; isn't in the best of states. As long as a child finishes school knowing how to use Word, Excel, and Powerpoint it is considered a success. They have been taught everything they need to know about computers. But let's be honest here, a basic knowledge of office tools won't help you to build a website, or fix a basic computer problem. And if a child is only being taught how to use a computer, how can it be expected that their generation will build the next version of computers and office tools?</p>
					<p>When a child is brought up being taught how to consume, but not produce there is a problem, and it is becoming evident in the computing industry now.</p>

					<h2>The solution</h2>
					<p>The solution sounds simple on paper, but in practice it isn't. A child enjoys using technology, that much is evident. They'd be happy playing something like Temple Run or Angry Birds on their parent's phone, so what is stopping them from building their own games? Simply put, they aren't being encouraged to do so. No one is assisting or teaching a child to use basic forms of code to build a simple app or game in the normal school environment. When the child is at home they aren't much better off as their parents probably don't know how to code either.</p>
					<p>Code isn't really taught until you get to do your A-levels, and that is only if you choose it, and quite honestly most of the people choosing to do computing at college already know how to code. Everyone else has given up with computing thinking that they are just going to be learning more about office tools. Also, the code taught in colleges in my local area is Visual Basic, not an ideal really.</p>
					<p>One of the solutions has already been started. A simple after school-club scheme called <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk">codeclub</a> is active in 1586 schools in the UK. That statistic sounds amazing, but there are actually 24,328 schools &#40;January 2013 school census&#41;, meaning that only 6&#37; of schools have this scheme. After school clubs aren't ideal either. Not every child attends them, so although it is a great idea that deserves a lot of support, there is a better solution. &#40;It's also proven that the sessions are 92&#37; fun, meaning that you should defiantly encourage it.&#41;</p>
					<p>If schools were to scrap the office tools in ICT in primary schools and instead introduce very basic programming such as <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, before moving on to HTML and CSS and then more complex things such as Python or Java, and have this as a national curriculum rather than a sponsored after school club then you have your solution.</p>
					<p>Bringing programming into the computing curriculum from an early age won't cause the child to become a programmer in later life, but it might encourage them to consider it, and if not? It's taught them something that is fast becoming an essential life skill and the idea of logical and structured thinking.</p>
					<p>I am aware that this isn't relevant for all of the world, but as UK citizen I can only comment on the situation here.</p>
