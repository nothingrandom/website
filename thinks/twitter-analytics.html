					<h2>Twitter Analytics</h2>
					<p>Last night, a friend of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/PenmanRoss">Ross Penman</a>, tweeted about his twitter analytics, and the gender ratio. Intrigued I looked at mine for comparison, and saw a noticeable difference on most of the statistics.</p>
					<p>At the time of writing this article, Ross has 1,323 followers, and I have 197. This should give us some nice comparison data.</p>
					<p>Ross and I both program, and primarily use Twitter for programming related things. Although, I also tweet about music - and recently, Ross has been tweeting about the upcoming Scottish Referendum.</p>

					<h2>Impressions and Engagements</h2>
					<p>In 28 days, my tweets have had 6.9K impressions. According to Twitter, an impression is <span class="italic">&quot;the number of times users saw the tweet on Twitter.&quot;</span> Whereas, engagements, the number we should actually care about, is calculated by <span class="italic">&quot;the total number of times a user interacted with a tweet. This includes clicks, retweets, replies, favorites, follows, and expansions.&quot;</span></p>
					<p>I have 35 times more impressions than followers, but that is over a 28 day period and with multiple tweets per day. I also have a 3.8% engagement rate.</p>
					<p>Comparing this with Ross' data, he has 122.5K impressions, which works out to 92.6 times his number of followers, again, this is over a 28 day period and with multiple tweets &#40;arguably more tweets per day than me&#41;. His engagement rate is surprisingly similar, with 3.5%.</p>
					<p>Twitter, isn't kind enough to give us the amount of tweets per day, so this data cannot be accurately analyzed, but generally speaking - almost all of our followers see our tweets, we don't know how many people read our tweets in-depth, and we have a seemingly low engagement rate.</p>

					<h2>Follower statistics</h2>
					<p>As well as telling us about our tweets and their reach, Twitter also tells us about our followers.</p>
					<p>Both of our starting points are quite similar in regards to the growth of our followers. I know for me, personally, the first 10 months I barely used Twitter, and it was mostly family and friends that followed me. But then I started to use Twitter more frequently for programming and networking with other programmers and saw an increase in followers. When <a href="https://twitter.com/anna_debenham">Anna Debenham</a> first tweeted about me, after I got in contact, my follower count rose by 15. This continued at a steady pace until I reached 86 followers. And then I got nominated for a net award, any my follower count rose by another 26. Then when I wrote a blog post about the time <a href="http://nothingrandom.com/blog/newsnight-talk-code.html">Newsnight talked about code</a>, my follower count jumped up again. Since then, I've had another two jumps, but I cannot tell what caused them.</p>
					<p>If we compare this to Ross' data...</p>
					<img src="http://nothingrandom.com/images/thinks/rossfollowers.png" alt="Ross followers" class="full">
					<p class="image-caption">Ross' followers</p>
					<p>We can see he had quite a different "follower story". His followers remain relatively low &#40;climbing to a total of 350, which compared to my current follower count isn't that low&#41;. Until he had a jump and the growth continued at a steady, but faster than before, pace.</p>

					<h2>Gender Ratio</h2>
					<p>We're male teenagers working in a primarily male dominated industry, so you'd expect most of our followers to follow suit. However, quite surprisingly, this isn't true.</p>
					<p>Ross' data shows that he has a follower ratio of 87:13, M:F. I have a ratio of 71:29. It's quite a helpful statistic, showing us how many females on Twitter are interested in the web industry.</p>
					<p>But, how does Twitter know gender? When you first sign up for twitter, it never asks for your age or your gender. So the technicians at Twitter have worked out some clever algorithm which can identify gender from either a profile picture or the content of tweets. It would be nice to know how Twitter calculates this, and how accurate it is.</p>

					<h2>Other countries</h2>
					<p>We both have a larger number of UK followers, compared to any other country. My followers break up into a 59:16:15:3:3:2:2:2 ratio of UK:USA:Other:NLD:FRA:IND:SPA:AUS respectively.</p>
					<p>I am unsure of Ross' ratios, but looking at the image he gave me, we have impact in the same countries &#40;bar the few extra he has&#41; and it looks like some of the countries have a similar sort of break up.</p>
					<p>We can also see the cities of which our followers are from, mine being London, Brighton &#40;my hometown&#41;, Manchester, New York, and Amsterdam. Ross has London, San Francisco, and New York. 25&#37; of my followers are from the cities I have impact in. Only 14&#37; of the followers Ross has are from the cities has impact in, showing that his followers are more widespread.</p>

					<h2>Interest</h2>
					<p>The final piece of data I want to look at, is the interests section. The interests section takes our followers interests into account, presumably by looking at other types of accounts that they follow. We both have very similar "unique interest" from our followers, with web design, computer programming, and open source both being in our top 5 list. Ross also has MacOS and startups. I have design and graphics software. Which, when looking at the types of things we tweet about, makes a lot of sense.</p>
					<p>There is a second section called "top interest", which are the top 5 non-unique interest of our followers. I only have the first 6 of Ross', so I'll only compare my first 6.</p>
					<p>We both have a high percentage in comedy &#40;possibly more accurately described as movies and television&#41;. Which doesn't make much sense, as neither of us tend to tweet about either topic much, but this is our followers' taste, and not ours. We both have high percentages in tech news and technology, Ross has a staggering 72&#37; in tech news and 69&#37; in technology. Mobile makes an appearance at number 6 on Ross' followers' interests, but doesn't appear anywhere on mine. My followers have an interest in music, which does make sense, because I do tweet about music semi-frequently. Surprisingly, they favor pop music, of which I have little to no interest in. Somehow, Ross seems to have attracted his target market better, probably due to the content of his tweets.</p>

					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>I look forward to seeing how Twitter expand and develop the analytics in the near future, and it'll be interesting to see how the demographics of my followers and in turn, Ross' change over the course of the next year. It'll also be interesting to see if the engagement of tweets rises or falls as the types of people who use Twitter, and the ways we access it, change.</p>
					<p>You can check out your analytics at <a href="https://analytics.twitter.com/">https://analytics.twitter.com/</a>. If you find anything interesting, I'd love to hear about it. You can either <a href="http://twitter.com/BenjaminHollway">tweet me</a> or <a href="mailto:benjamin@nothingrandom.com">email me</a>.</p>
