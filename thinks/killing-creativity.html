					<h2>Schools remove creativity</h2>
					<p>The school system strong discourages creativity. It teaches that there is a wrong or right answer, but never a creative answer. It gives marks dependent on if you remembered the answer to the specific question, and not if you learnt something. Art students are graded on both creativity and technique, when in practice they should only be graded on their technique.</p>

					<h2>How this kills creativity</h2>
					<p>When a student beings to think in only a right&#47;wrong answer thought pattern they no longer feel comfortable being creativity. They fear being incorrectly creative. The fear that they cannot get the right answer for their creativity and are never creative because of it.</p>

					<h2>You cannot learn creativity</h2>
					<p>You can't learn to be creative, you can only learn to improve your technique. However, you become more creative by practicing. We should start encouraging others to become more creative, rather than judge what they create.</p>
