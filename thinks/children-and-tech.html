					<h2>Children, technology, and public transport</h2>
					<p>Picture this, you are travelling on the bus or train and a few seats over from you is a young parent and their child. The child is between the ages of 3 and 5. The child begins to cry. Much to your surprise, the parent gets out their smart phone, launches a basic game, hands it to the child and then... silence. The child stops crying.</p>
					<p>Admittedly I don't use public transport a lot, but I've been seeing this happen a lot recently. It is seemingly done without a second thought. Without batting an eyelid, but could this behaviour be damaging rather than helpful?</p>

					<h2>Children and their ownership of technology</h2>
					<p>Children and their ownership of technology is surprising, in the year 2013 the number of children aged 5&ndash;15 who own a mobile phone was 43&#37;. A 6&#37; drop from the year 2012. 26&#37; of children aged 12&ndash;15 now own a tablet, up from 7&#37; in 2012.</p>
					<p>Another shocking figure? 28&#37; of infants use a tablet at home. &#40;source <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24384814">BBC News</a>&#41;</p>
					<p>If you read the BBC article quoted above it closes in a surprising way. <span id="quote">&quot;The statistics also suggest that the next generation is getting tech savvy not long after getting out of nappies&quot;</span></p>
					<p>BBC, would you care to clarify what you mean by &quot;tech savvy&quot;? Just because a child or infant excessively uses or owns technology it doesn't make them savvy about it. If anything, children know less about technology now than ever before.</p>

					<h2>What tech savvy actually is</h2>
					<p>Tech savvy. Let's break down the word. Savvy means to know or understand. Thus meaning that to be tech savvy would mean that you know or understand technology. If you can use something does it mean you are actually savvy? No.</p>
					<p>Take a common problem with computers. Say the wifi cuts out on 1 device out of 3 in a household. There are some default steps that could be taken.</p>
					<p>1) Use 1 of the 2 devices that continues to work.</p>
					<p>2) Restart the router or wireless base station.</p>
					<p>3) Phone a family member who knows about technology.</p>
					<p>4) Phone the ISP and ask for help.</p>
					<p>Repeatedly these are the only steps that families and children will take - or even know about - proving that they aren't as tech savvy as they first make out. Obviously knowing how to fix a wifi problem won't change the world. But if a simple task like this cannot be accomplished, how can we expect them to do bigger things, like be behind the next wave of technological advances?</p>

					<h2>The future needs change, and fast</h2>
					<p>The problem is caused by something quite simple. You and me.</p>
					<p>Children are frequently handed technology on a plate. Remember the first example, where the parent gives their child their phone when they cry? They are being handed technology on a plate.</p>
					<p>This leads the child to have no desire to learn how to fix their problems themselves. No desire how to build their own technology. No desire on learning how to build their own software for computers.</p>
					<p>The 3rd computer our family owned was a custom built PC. Something that we build ourselves. Something that I was a part of building. That created interest for me in computers, I would, just from doing it once, know how to swap a hard-drive, RAM, and motherboard out of a computer. However, we cannot give every child this experience.</p>
					<p>What we need is cheap, easy to use computer that needs programming with loads of resources on how to get started. Something also commonly known as a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>. Unfortunately, the Pi isn't all too child friendly, luckily there is something called the <a href="http://www.kano.me">Kano Kit</a>. A colourful and exciting project designed for the younger generation, and it was completely crowd funded!</p>

					<h2>The ultimate goal</h2>
					<p>Setting the children a goal of knowing how to program and possibly become computer programmers cannot happen without the knowledge of fixing every day computing problems.</p>
					<p>The first priority in a classroom shouldn't be to teach programming. Children should learn to fix common everyday computing faults first, and then learn how to program computers. There is a wide spectrum of jobs to choose from, and not every child will choose pick an occupation that requires programming, but every child will pick an occupation that will in some way or form require the usage of technology. Let's give them something that will be used frequently before giving them something that only some of them will need or use.</p>
					<p>Having every child know 10 different programming languages is an unrealistic expectation. Even 1 or 2 is unrealistic. Not every child will enjoy or understand programming, and frankly, that's ok. They have personal preferences, if they don't want to become a computer scientist, who are we to stop them, but we can at least tell them what a computer scientist does.</p>
