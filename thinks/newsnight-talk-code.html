					<h2>A quick summary of the situation</h2>
					<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mk25">Newsnight</a> is a BBC television show that discusses news topics. The show that was broadcasted on the 5th of February featured an article about code and bringing it to schools. Quite frankly, it was shocking.</p>

					<p>Currently the clip is going through a stage of being deleted and reuploaded. I'll try and keep the link here as up to date as possible.</p>

					<h2>Highlighting some early mistakes</h2>
					<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Paxman">Jeremy Paxman</a> opens well, he appears to know what he is talking about. However, a couple of the things that he says appear to be false the further into the piece. This probably isn't his fault as it is scripted by someone else. He then hands over to <a href="https://twitter.com/zoeconway1">Zoe Conway</a> who uses some really strange language within her slot, including &quot;baffling&quot; and &quot;gobbledygook&quot;. Two words that you should never use to describe programming of any kind.</p>
					<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lilycole">Lily Cole</a> gets interviewed in Zoe's segment. She does reasonably well. Unfortunately she mentions that they made a website in a day. Although this is possible, when code comes to schools I doubt many of the children will be building a fully featured website on the first day. She also uses the word &quot;cool&quot; a little bit excessively.</p>
					<p>Then the Year of Code ad shows briefly, before Zoe mentions the fact that the government want to bring coding to schools from the ages of 5&ndash;16. But the idea that 5 is too young is another topic altogether.</p>
					<p>Anyone else notice that almost everyone featured so far is female? This is currently an unrealistic expectation. Although it is good that Newsnight is promoting it this way, only 30&#37; of employees in the web industry are women.</p>

					<h2>Further analysis</h2>
					<p>The focus then moves on to the fact that there is a <a href="next-generation-coders">shortage of programmers</a> and the fact that the UK is no longer leading the way.</p>
					<p><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/mikewarriner">Mike Warriner</a>, the Engineering Director at Google then gets interviewed. I may have misinterpreted the last bit wrong. He makes it sound like there used to be kids coming out of school, from the UK, being taught code?</p>
					<p><span id="italic"><a href="http://twitter.com/peterc">Peter Cooper</a> later informed me via <a href="https://twitter.com/peterc/status/431757959610503168">this tweet</a> that he was given a brief overview of code during school. The programming languages he was taught were Logo and Pascal. They are mentioned in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/31/why-kids-should-be-taught-code">this Guardian article</a>.</span></p>
					<p>We then get taken to a classroom where 10 and 11 year olds are being taught to code. Realistically, it's an ideal age to being teaching. <a href="http://code-club.org">Code Club</a> has been teaching from 9 &ndash; an even better age. But the idea of starting at age 5 is ridiculous.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, the conclusion we can draw from the school is that most of the kids have almost no idea why they are learning to code, and the teacher is finding it all a little bit daunting. The method she is using to teach her pupils is <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> which requires minimal classroom teacher communication. However, if they have any questions or need some help, she'll probably struggle to offer that assistance.</p>
					<p>We then get shown a clip from an interview with <a href="http://oliverrees.co.uk">Oliver Rees</a> who highlights the fact that unless kids are interested they are going to get bored. A completely relevant and true point.</p>

					<h2>And then we get to Lottie</h2>
					<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Lottiedexter">Lottie Dexter</a> opens by proclaiming that she cannot code and hasn't even attempted to learn. This means that we know one definite thing from her.</p>
					<p>1) Anything she says may be incorrect information.</p>
					<p>She then says she is going to commit the next year to learning how to code, to which Jeremy seems startled. Not a fantastic start.</p>
					<p>At which point shes says something that had me startled and almost falling off my seat. &quot;You can actually build a website in an hour.&quot; First Lily says a day, and now Lottie says an hour. Neither of them are correct. A professional may be able to build a rough mock website in a day, but an hour? I hope no kids see this, or they are going to go home disappointed after their first session learning to code.</p>
					<p>At this point I'd already fallen off my seat once, and this time I'm in for an even bigger surprise. Lottie claims that a teacher can learn how to teach code in a day. A DAY. I didn't know if I should laugh or cry. What's worse, is that she isn't misinformed. This is the actual plan. You can read about this project <a href="http://decoded.co/us/codeED-in-a-day/">here</a>.</p>
					<p>A question may have arisen in the back of your mind. Why has Lottie, who has got this far without knowing one line of code, set aside 1 year to learn while teachers, who will be teaching thousands of children to code, only get given 1 day?</p>
					<p>For the next couple of questions Lottie does alright.</p>
					<p>Then Jeremy tries to get his head around what code is. &quot;Different symbols...&quot; to which Lottie gestures at the wall behind her covered with blurred code nonsense. Not the best impression to give. People already think code is complicated, why make it appear complicated as well?</p>

					<h2>What is this about ecards?</h2>
					<p>Lottie says that when coding comes to schools the idea will be that the code produces an ecard.</p>
					<p>Wait... WHAT? An ecard? What use is an ecard to anyone? What use is a national initiative to teach children how to make virtual cards, as Jeremy so rightly put it.</p>
					<p>Lottie then corrects herself by also mentioning websites and apps, but in reality, ecards should have never been brought up in the first place.</p>

					<h2>A quick recap</h2>
					<p>I could have gone better. It could have gone worse. It'll be interesting to see how it all pans out. It will also be interesting to discover what the community support is form the idea.</p>
					<p>At the moment it appears a portion of the project is being run by people who don't know how to code. You can view more information about the idea <a href="http://yearofcode.org">here</a>.</p>
					<p>If you are a developer, and you want to help teach code in an already tried, tested, and successful method, you can volunteer to help at an after school club scheme known as <a href="http://code-club.org">Code Club</a>.</p>
					<p>You can also find the complete dialogue of everything that Lottie said on the <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/and-this-lottie-is-the-internet">Stuff and Nonsense blog</a>.</p>
