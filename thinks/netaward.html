					<h2>Crazy things are happening</h2>
					<p>The <a href="https://thenetawards.com">net awards</a> are a yearly award ceremony for web design and development. They often showcase some of the big names. This year that, among others, includes the Dropbox and Twitter design team in the &quot;<a href="https://thenetawards.com/vote/team/" target="_blank">Team of the Year</a>&quot; catagory. Some amazing people have been nominated for a wide variety of catagories. One of these catagories is the &quot;<a href="https://thenetawards.com/vote/talent/" target="_blank">Emerging Talent of the Year</a>&quot;.</p>
					<p>Earlier in January the nomination stage opened. I saw a tweet about the awards and thought I'd check it out. Roughly 30 minutes after I noticed that the net awards were a thing, and I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/anna_debenham/status/410724675056967680" target="_blank">this tweet</a>. I thought there was nothing to loose, so I asked to be nominated, and it appears that a few people did.</p>
					<p>Then on Tuesday afternoon the voting opened. And there was my name, in black and white. &#40;Ok, it's gold and white really...&#41; A massive thank you to everyone who nominated me! If you feel like voting for me, you can view my page and the other nominations <a href="https://thenetawards.com/vote/talent/benjamin-hollway/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
					<h3>Update 26/2/14</h3>
					<p>Since the awards began, I've also participated in the <a href="/work/netdesign">Net Mag Design Challenge.</a></p>
					<h3>Update 31/3/14</h3>
					<p>I've been shortlisted in my catagory.</p>
					<h3>Update 13/5/14</h3>
					<p><a href="http://twitter.com/imjen">Jen Lamere</a> won the Emerging Talent catagory. It was great to be nominated and shortlisted, and I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to vote for me.</p>
