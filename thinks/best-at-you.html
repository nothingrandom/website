					<p>It's cliche, but the best person at being you - is you.</p>
					<h2>The last couple of months</h2>
					<p>I'd like to think I've changed a lot recently. For the time being education is over, and I'm now working full time. I started with a 3 month internship at <a href="http://builtbybuffalo.com/">Built by Buffalo</a> in September. From there, I moved on to working full time with the team at <a href="https://metropoly.co.uk/">Metropoly</a>. Alongside that, I'm working on a mix of personal projects and freelance side projects. I'm also beginning to get more heavily involved in live sound engineering. I've become busier, and I've learnt a lot. There is still a lot to learn though.</p>
					<h2>Self acceptance</h2>
					<p>This is something that everyone struggles with. Working out who you are, and then actually accepting that. As we walk through life, we encounter many hurdles. I find it odd that our biggest hurdle is often ourself. This is something that I've recently been working through.</p>
					<p>"Finding myself", learning what I like and what I don't. Trying to work out what I want in life. One of the biggest stumbling blocks, is listening to what other people think of you. Believing you have to dress, speak and act a certain way, hang out with a group of people, or listen to a specific type of music in order to be accepted by society.</p>
					<p>At the end of the day, what matters more? What others think of you, or making sure you're happy?</p>
					<p>I'm slowly moving myself out of this box that I've placed myself in. Stepping outside of my comfort zone, and doing things because I enjoy them. Not because I want people to accept me.</p>
					<p>Let's be honest here, if someone doesn't accept you for being you - are they worth changing for?</p>
