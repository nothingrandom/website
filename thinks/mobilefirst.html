					<h2>Internet Traffic</h2>
					<p>Mobile devices both old and new, smart and "dumb" are becoming increasingly popular world wide. Although figures are mostly estimations and slightly outdated it is presumed that there are over 6.8 billion phones, of those, over 1.5 billion are smart phones. That's a large amount of phones, and together that makes up for roughly 15&#37; of all traffic. &#40;Figures are from estimations and measurements from 2012.&#41; These numbers are growing as well. Over the course of 2013, 90&#37; of mobile device purchases were Android or Apple devices.</p>
					<p>An increasing number of designers and developers are moving toward the &quot;mobile first&quot; method. This method involves designing and developing a website around the mobile experience <span class="italic">before</span> thinking about desktop users. While this way of thinking may seem beneficial, is it changing the way that the internet is created?</p>

					<h2>Desktop should be first</h2>
					<p>Desktop users result for slightly less than 85&#37; of all traffic &#40;estimation based on 2011 measurements&#41;. This is a hefty chunk of traffic. Admittedly, using a mobile when out and about or just to check something rapidly can be useful, but when you are spending a larger amount of time on a specific objective you will probably choose to use a larger screen.</p>
					<p>When you are designing the first views of a website in the Adobe Suite what are you using, a mobile or desktop? What about when you are building the site?</p>
					<p>You should be building for the platform with the larger market share, and building for the platform of which you are using at the time. While building for desktop, don't eliminate mobile, consider mobile users as well, but they come second with the current market.</p>

					<h2>Mobile is still vital</h2>
					<p>Building for a mobile experience is vital. Without a mobile based website you are going to loose a large amount of traffic and users. If someone cannot use your site with a mobile device then they'll just leave and try one of your competitors instead. Creating an optimal mobile experience is key.</p>
					<p>In order to do this you should always take what you'd want to be experiencing into mind. Also consider system defaults, don't make the font really large or really small but keep it as close to the system default sizes as possible. The closer your website is to a mobile experience, the better, but don't substitute a mobile experience for a desktop experience.</p>

					<h2>How mobile has changed our internet</h2>
					<p>Mobile devices have managed to change the way we use the internet over the last 2 or 3 years. There have been rapid changes to the way websites are built and created from the simple things to the complex structures.</p>
					<p>Flash has been eliminated from websites because of it's lack of responsiveness. This is a strong advancement, letting HTML5 and CSS3 replace it with animations and more advanced features than before.</p>
					<p>Mobiles are also changing the structure of webpages, eliminating specific areas of a site or moving it to a new place on a page thus causing a more fluid experience both on a mobile and desktop.</p>

					<h2>Things mobiles cannot do</h2>
					<p>Something to always be considered, if you are mobile first or mobile last, is what the large portion of internet enabled phones can and cannot do. This ultimately depends on the mobile that you are using, but when looking at the narrow spectrum of most mobile internet users there are some specifics that they don't like.</p>
							<h3>Web Fonts</h3>
							<p>Some phones handle fonts amazingly. They are able to pull in fonts through nearly every method. However, over 370 million devices using Opera Mini have a short coming. They don't like &quot;&#64;font&ndash;face&quot;. The &quot;&#64;font&ndash;face&quot; is the method for importing a font that is stored on a server in a font file. With Opera Mini not supporting this feature it means that a large number of users cannot import fonts, meaning that you should always design with a back&ndash;up alternative to importing fonts.
							<h3>Text Rendering</h3>
							<p>Admittedly, this isn't just a problem with mobile devices, but also with some desktop devices. When using fancy fonts some phones cannot handle them. They get turned into a pixelated mess or get given a fuzzy look. There are plenty of work arounds for this, but something to be considered</p>
							<h3>Screen size</h3>
							<p>The biggest problem with mobile devices is the diverse amount of screen sizes. You have large screens and tiny screens and every single size between them. Killer tactic&#58; find the most common sizes and aim to build around them, the rest should follow. &#40;320x240, 470x320, 640x480, 640x960, 960x720 to name a few.&#41; This also means that you should <span class="italic">never</span> use flash to build a website.</p>
							<h3>Internet Speed</h3>
							<p>At home you have a broadband connection, ethernet or a powerful wireless connection. When out with a mobile you are using mobile speeds. Shared wifi or 3/4G. It is far from ideal and considerably slower. The more images, the slower the load times. Something that always needs to be considers is load times for a web page. The faster the better.</p>
