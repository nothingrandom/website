					<p><span class="italic">One of the most difficult things I’ve had to deal with since I started working in this industry is my age. I experience age discrimination much more than I experience any form of gender discrimination. - <a href="https://twitter.com/anna_debenham">Anna Debenham</a> on a <a href="http://scrunchup.com/article/2010-11-21-ageism">blog post</a> written in 2010.</span></p>

					<p>4 years later, this is now true to me.</p>

					<p>- Every tech event I’ve ever attended has an after party at a club/bar/pub. I can never get access. Sometimes, really nice people decide to hang out with me instead. Other times, I’m forced to go home.</p>
					<p>- Freelancing has been nearly impossible because people don’t trust a teenager to deliver on promises, or to know what they are doing.</p>
					<p>- Conferences are expensive to young people. It costs a few hundred pounds per ticket and then some for travel expenses. And all the after parties are in clubs/bars/pubs, which I can’t access.</p>

					<p>There is definitely an age bias against younger people, you cannot deny it. The problem is, nothing is being done to resolve it.</p>

					<p>This is an ever growing community, and not everyone is over 18 (or 21 in America). In a 2009 survey, 2 in 100 people were under 18 in this industry. I fear, however, this hasn’t grown due to a closed system of age bias and elitism. It makes it hard for young people to get actively involved.</p>

					<p>A large number of under 21s have started tech organisations and projects, and had to struggle through age bias to get there. Imagine, if you could have had a part to play in their story because you were there to offer guidance and advice, or were just a friend to them.</p>


					<p>It can be really intimidating going up to someone you respect, saying hello, and asking for advice. It can be tough to write emails or tweets asking for pointers. And it can be a challenge to write a blog post highlighting the issue.</p>

					<p><span class="italic">I know that these problems will go away when I’m older. - Anna Debenham</span></p>

					<p>However, I don’t see why I, or anyone else, should need to wait. The industry should be happy to welcome young people, who are willing to join the community with open arms. In fact, the industry needs us.</p>

					<p>I definitely don’t have the answer or solution to this problem as I’ve never hosted or organised an event myself, but I can offer a few ideas to consider.</p>

					<h2>Maybe pubs are not where after parties should happen</h2>
					<p>Countless times, I’ve heard people saying that after an event they just want a quiet venue which serves drinks. They want to be able to chat with others. Quiet venues are often open to under 18s.</p>

					<h2>Free tickets for students/interns</h2>
					<p>Young people don’t have money, fact. Events have lots of sponsors, fact. If sponsors would be willing to over massively reduced, or even a number of free tickets, to under 18s - that’d be wonderful. If the event organisers can’t afford this, under 18s make enthusiastic volunteers.</p>

					<h2>More young people to speak at events and on podcasts</h2>
					<p>I’d love to give this a try, and I’ve asked around trying to get an opportunity to do this a few times before. Without success. So drop me a line if you’re interested. If you’re a attendee of events and listener of podcasts, be open to receiving to young people, you might just be surprised.</p>

					<p>If we can start to do a few of these things, I’d be very happy. I’m also sure that we’ll see an increase in community active people who are under 18.</p>
