					<p>I’ve made the choice to start working freelance. I’m not sure if this will be a long term decision, or whether this’ll only be for a couple of months before I get employed by another agency or startup. I guess the only way to find out will be to wait and see.</p>
					<p>One of the many benifits of being freelance, in my mind, is being able to choose your own clients. Not having to waste time on dead-end projects, but being able to work with clients with great ideas.</p>
					<p>I also hope that by going freelance I’ll have more time to work on personal projects. Spend more time with family and friends. Be able to focus on things outside of work more often. I hope that not being constricted to a Monday - Friday, 9-5 work schedule these things will be possible.</p>
					<p>But, alas, I write this at half 5 on a bank holiday. My inbox is getting cluttered with new email, and my todo list is full. I’m not sure how well that’ll work out.</p>
