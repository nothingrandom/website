					<p>For the past month, I've been travelling. A friend and myself decided that before he moved away for university, we ought to take the opportunity to travel a bit. We decided that the best option for doing so would be <a href="http://interrail.eu">interrail</a>, and utilise <a href="http://airbnb.com">AirBnB</a>. After months of planning (we started in September), we finally had our 11 locations. Brussels, Amsterdam, Wengen, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Venice, Rome, Athens, Budapest, and Paris.</p>

					<p>And so, on the 30th of June we left Brighton and got on a train to London St. Pancras with the aim of getting the Eurostar to Brussels. After waiting for over an hour we were informed that protestors had set tyres on fire at the other end of the Eurostar and we weren't going to be leaving the UK that day. Thankfully, the person we were staying with in Brussels, Ann, had a son whom lived in Greenwich who was able to put us up for the night.</p>

					<p>The following day, we caught a flight from Gatwick to Brussels as we didn't fancy risking it a second time as well. The flight was rather uneventful. We met Ann at the airport, and enjoyed an evening including roast lamb, beer, and pool (the cue sport, not swimming).</p>

					<p>Due to the previous two days, we only had one day in Brussels. Ann kindly took us for a brief tour and lunch, before we had a train to catch to Amsterdam. We arrived in Amsterdam in a bit of a heat wave, and our 15kg rucksacks were becoming a bit of an issue. We made our way over to our AirBnB location. Onno lived on the 4th floor, which was a bit of a climb considering the stereotypical dutch stairs. After our first grocery shop, we cooked some pasta and took a night time stroll ending at a pub (can you see a running theme yet?). During the next two days in Amsterdam we hired bikes and met with some friends for a picnic.</p>

					<p>Our next train was our first of four sleepers. It wasn't until after this first night train we realised how bad the other 4 had the potential to be. Although when we arrived in Zurich we were tired, we hadn't lost a day travelling - so it was a tit for tat situation. We proceeded to get a train to Wengen, which is a small tourist town 3 hours from Zurich and 1200 meters above sea level. We arrived stunned by the beauty of the area. That evening we decided to watch the sun set and see the stars come out. We spent a total of 4 days in Switzerland, filled with mountain side walks, country air, sun rises and sun sets and many stars. Switzerland is a truly stunning country, one which I'm sure I'll be revisiting again in the future. On our last day in Switzerland we made our way back down to Interlaken where we took a swim before heading to Zurich for our next night train to Berlin.</p>

					<p>We arrived slightly bleary eyed, but were met by a friend, Neville, who we'd be staying with. He took us back to his for Weetabix and Marmite (I'd seriously missed both by this point) and another friend of ours, Ads, turned up. Ads would showing us around Berlin during our first day. The tour with Ads focus largely on the historic side of Berlin and Germany, which was really nice as we often only get taught about the World Wars in schools. We went back to Ads' that evening for chicken noodle soup which I must get the recipe for. The following day Neville took us for a tour, focusing more on the tourist destinations in Berlin. That evening we met up with a larger group of friends for a BBQ.</p>

					<p>Before we knew it, our time in Berlin was over and we were getting a train to Prague. We did a bit of general sight seeing - but the thing the stuck out most to me was the quality of food for the price you paid. We got a 2 course meal with alcohol for under £7 total. Although there wasn't a lot to do in Prague, it allowed us to have a bit of time to catch our breaths again.</p>

					<p>Soon after we were getting another train to Vienna. Vienna was a bit of a surprising city. We both had low expectations, but when we actually got there Vienna was a great city. The architecture was great and there was quite a lot to see. On our first day there, we took a train to Semmering for some more country air and mountains. The following day, we spent walking around seeing sights such as Schönbrunn Palace and Hundertwasserhaus. After our final day in Vienna it was time for our third night train to Venice.</p>

					<p>The Venice night train was slightly different. The first two were run by City Night Line, and the seats were laid out in aisles of two. However, this night train which was run by EuroNight was laid out in small coaches of 6 seats. The start of the journey was relatively uneventful, but later on we were joined by 3 Russian girls in our compartments. We got to talking, and found that they were studying European law. Our conversation soon turned into a discussion about Russia and the current political situation, and it was interesting to hear it from a different point of view.</p>

					<p>When we finally arrived in Venice, we were hit by a combination of heat and humidity. It was roughly 37°, but felt like it was in the low 40s. We struggled to enjoy Venice properly due to heat, but thankfully our room was air conditioned. Overnight we set the air con to 16°, but the remote stopped working and we spent most of the night shivering. From one extreme to the next. The day we spent in Venice was okay, but I think that to properly enjoy the city you'd have to go in spring or autumn.</p>

					<p>Our next stop was Rome, which is one city I've always wanted to visit. The main focus for our visit there was the architecture and buildings. We spent the first evening visiting the Roman Forum. The following day we visited both the Colloseum and Circus Maximus. Our visit to Rome was brief, and we were soon on a flight to Athens - another city I'd always wanted to visit.</p>

					<p>During our first day we walked up to the top of Acropolis to see  the Parthenon. The view from the top gave us a nice look over the rest of the city, on one side there are mountains and the other the sea. That evening we decided to walk down to the sea front to watch sun set - which was a rather unique experience. We managed to exhaust ourselves on the first day, so the following day was spent walking around some of the back streets trying to find some souvineers and enjoying the city.</p>

					<p>Once again, we were on a plane. This time to Budapest. We'd heard a lot of good things about Budapest, but weren't completely sure what to expect. I think it's safe to say that we both enjoyed our visit there. Budapest was a city that had only just finished rebuilding itself after WW2, so although some of the buildings were quite old, the actual materials were not. One of my highlights in Budapest was seeing it lit up at night, as all the bridge lights reflected in the river, Danube. To get to our final stop, Paris, we had our final night train to Munich where we'd get a connection to Paris.</p>

					<p>While waiting for our train, we ended up speaking to a refugee family who were on their second attempt at the trip to Germany. They'd made it from Syria through a mix of trains and walking. We'd made it into Germany, but at the stop before Munich the train stopped. It was border control, they were finding illegal refugees in every carriage. They must have led nearly 200 off of the train. It was quite a daunting moment, as I realised that there's a lot of freedom for me to move between countries as I will - while many struggle to even leave their home country.</p>

					<p>We finally made it to Paris, after a desperate visit to Starbucks in Munich. The final AirBnB home we were staying in had cats, which is when I discovered that I had a cat allergy. Paris was a beautiful city, and it was clear how it had gained its name "the city of love". We saw the Eiffel Tower by night, and a jazz band playing beside the Seien. We even had a wonderful meal in a slightly hipster part of town. But before long, it was all over. It was time to return back to Brighton - we were both exhausted, so we were grateful that the EuroStar journey went more smoothly that last time. We made it back home at gone midnight, hugged and parted ways.</p>

					<p>Travelling was an amazing experience, and I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone. Although, now it's time to sleep.</p>
