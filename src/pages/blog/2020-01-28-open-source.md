I've realised the more I've been working at project companies how hard it is to show projects on a portfolio. This was true even when I was working at agencies, there was always a NDA in place.
I also came to the conclusion that I've been relying to using `yarn add` or `npm install` to solve so many of my problems without much thought to the work that goes on behind it.

So for this year, and the foreseeable future I'm going to try contributing more. Fixing my own issues, solving others, open sourcing small modules I use and make for my own use. I think this'll have a tiny impact on the community, and also help me improve my own skills, writing code in areas I'm currently not completely comfortable in.

I've started by creating a few small npm modules; [ydmo](https://github.com/nothingrandom/ydmo), [roll](https://github.com/nothingrandom/roll), [varops](https://github.com/nothingrandom/varops), [u8array](https://github.com/nothingrandom/u8array). After reading some tweets and AMA replies by [sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) such as [this one](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/10), I came to a conclusion that writing a fully fledged project isn't the only way to contribute to open source. Something I probably knew for a while, but didn't really think about properly.

I challenge you to do the same, let's see what kind of difference we can make.
