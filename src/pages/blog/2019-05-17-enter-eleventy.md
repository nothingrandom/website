For those of you who don't know, Eleventy otherwise known as [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/) is a "simple static site generator". It's pretty awesome, both in that it generates from markdown, HTML, nunjucks, handlebars, Javascript template literals (and more), but it's also crazy fast.

I'm loving it, it's probably one of the first times I've properly started using a static site generator, as before I started doing Javascript web apps full-time I was building websites on gulp. 11ty may very well be just another fad, but with the flexibility it gives I don't mind. It's slick, it's customisable, and it's allowed me to create "just a website" build in a fun way, for the first time in a long time.

I'm also, for the first time, not "deploying" this website by building locally and uploading new files via FTP. This site is now built in the background by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). That's pretty freaking awesome too. It means I can write blog posts, recipes, change content, play with new concepts and ideas without having to deal with a FTP client. Which should mean things stay up to date more, because I won't be dreading it anymore.

Full disclosure, this isn't sponsored by either 11ty or Netlify. Although they're welcome to reach out to me if they want to 😉.
