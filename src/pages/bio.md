### I'm Benjamin, in summary, a lead frontend / Javascript engineer based in {{ myself.currentLocation }}. And a lover of good food.

{{ myself.currently | safe }} {{ myself.fe }} {{ myself.resume | safe }}

Every once in a while I'll either be creating or contributing to an [open source project](https://github.com/nothingrandom) (often in the form of a node module), and a little more frequently than that I mix live sound.

During my downtime, there's few things better than playing fetch with our {{ '24-08-2020' | timeSince('life') }} old border collie, [Nova](https://www.instagram.com/novathegoodboy/). And sometimes cycling to new locations to take pictures in new places. My wife, [Indy](https://instagram.com/indy_hollway), and I love to create indie/jazz/fusion music with our assortment of synths and guitars. Whenever possible we take a vacation to hike in the mountains, discovering trails off the beaten path.

I believe food is the heart of every home, and following the legacy of many a British man before me; I have a [food and recipe blog](/food). I'm currently looking to get some of my food into local cafes - so [watch this space](https://instagram.com/foodwithbenjamin), with a dream of maybe opening one myself in years to come.</p>

We moved to Amsterdam together in March 2017, and feel like this big (but small) city matches our personalities. If you're ever in {{ myself.currentLocation }} and share my love for food, coffee, local beers, or obscure indie music, let's chat.
