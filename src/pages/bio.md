### I'm Benjamin, in summary, a lead frontend / Javascript engineer based in Amsterdam. And a lover of good food.

I currently work at the IoT & satellite startup [Hiber](https://hiber.global), building their frontend web applications with a mix of the latest ES & TypeScript specs, Vue.js, S/CSS, and pure magic. I've also been known to use React, Living Styleguides, build the occassional node module, and much more in the past. [Resume](/resume).

Every once in a while I'll either be creating or contributing to an [open source project](https://github.com/nothingrandom) and a little more frequently than that I mix live sound.

During my downtime, there's few things better than playing fetch with our {{ '24-08-2020' | timeSince }} old border collie, [Nova](). And sometimes cycling to new locations to take pictures in new places. My wife, [Indy](https://instagram.com/indy_hollway), and I love to create indie/jazz/fusion music with our assortment of synths and guitars. Whenever possible we take a vacation to hike in the mountains, discovering trails off the beaten path.

I believe food is the heart of every home, and following the legacy of many a British man before me; I have a [food and recipe blog](/food). I'm currently looking to get some of my food into local cafes - so [watch this space](https://instagram.com/foodwithbenjamin), with a dream of maybe opening one myself in years to come.</p>

We moved to Amsterdam together in March 2017 to join a young church, and feel like this big (but small) city matches our personalities. If you're ever in Amsterdam and share my love for food, coffee, local beers, or obscure indie music, let's chat.
