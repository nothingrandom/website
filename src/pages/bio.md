### I'm Benjamin, in summary, a lead javascript / frontend engineer based {{ myself.currentLocation }}. And a lover of good food.

{{ myself.currently | safe }} {{ myself.fe }} {{ myself.resume | safe }}

Every once in a while I'll either be creating or contributing to an [open source project](https://github.com/nothingrandom) (often in the form of a node module), and a little more frequently than that I mix live sound.

During my downtime, there's few things better than playing fetch with our {{ '24-08-2020' | timeSince('life') }} old border collie, [Nova](https://www.instagram.com/thebcsupernova/). My wife, [Indy](https://instagram.com/indiazoeann), and I love to take as much time as possible driving to explore hidden beaches, hike in the mountains, and discover trails off the beaten path.

I believe food is the heart of every home, and so keep a small [food and recipe blog](/food). I'd love to open my own cafe one day, and love discovering local favourites.</p>
