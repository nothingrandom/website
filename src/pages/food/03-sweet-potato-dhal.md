intro: There are few meals more satisfying and filling than dhal.⁣ This is my wife's family recipe for sweet potato dhal.⁣

ingredients: [1 large onion, 2 garlic cloves, 1 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tbsp naturally sweetened ketchup, 250g red split lentils, 2 large sweet potatoes (diced into bite size cubes optionally peeled), 600ml vegetable stock]

- Lightly fry the onion in a saucepan until it starts to brown.⁣
- Crush and add the garlic cloves, cook for a further minute.⁣
- Add the spices and a little bit of ketchup. Mix this over a low heat until nicely combined and the onion mix is coated.⁣
- Add the sweet potatoes and cook until slightly browned on the sides.
- Pour the lentils into the pan followed by the vegetable stock, which should cover the contents of the pan.
- Stir well, bring to the boil, then lower the temperature to a simmer and cover for 20-25 minutes.⁣

This pairs nicely with rice, chapatis or naan bread. I like to serve it with some mango juice and avocado.⁣
