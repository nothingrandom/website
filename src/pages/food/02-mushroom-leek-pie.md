intro: I recently discovered that the grocery store right near us sells vegan (notably dairy free) puff pastry. As a lover of pie, here's a leek, asparagus and mushroom pie - which I made without dairy, but you could easily include if you wished.

ingredients:
  - filling: [2 leeks (chopped into 1-2cm circles), 200g of asparagus (remove the woody parts then cut into halves), olive oil, 3 garlic cloves (crushed), 400g mushrooms, a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary and thyme, salt and pepper]
  - white sauce: [40g butter, 2 tbsp flour, 350ml of almond, oat or other alternative milk]
  - pastry: [1 270g sheet of ready-made pastry, 1 egg or some milk for brushing]

- Saut√© the leeks and asparagus in olive oil with the crushed garlic cloves, for only a couple of minutes or until the leek just starts to soften.
- Add the mushrooms (cutting the larger ones into smaller pieces), fresh mixed herbs (rosemary thyme), and season. Cover and cook for another 8 minutes.
- Make a white sauce in a saucepan; mix the butter and flour into a paste at a low heat, add the milk and continue stirring until the sauce thickens.
- Add in the vegetables and leave to cool down in the pan. Whilst you wait for this, preheat the oven to 200C.
- Put your filling into a pie dish, top with the pastry and press the edges down with a fork, brush with egg or more milk, then criss-cross with a knife.
- Cook for 25 minutes, serve with some lightly steamed or boiled veg & baby potatoes.
