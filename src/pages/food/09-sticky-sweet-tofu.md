intro: Sticky tofu noodles! Indy's favourite dish ðŸ˜‰

ingredients: [1 block of tofu, '1 tbsp coconut, sesame, or sunflower oil', 3 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp honey, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp ground coriander, black pepper, 2 garlic cloves]
---
- Optionally, press your block of tofu for 30+ minutes between a chopping board and some books (or a heavy casserole dish).
- Cut the tofu into cubes.
- Start to lightly fry the tofu in the oil, turning to brown and crisp all the sides taking care not to break any.
- When pale brown, pour over your dressing of soy sauce, honey, ginger, coriander, a generous grind of black pepper, and crushed garlic.
- Continue to cook for a further three minutes whilst the sauce / dressing thickens and becomes nice and sticky.
- Enjoy topped with sesame seeds and with stir fried egg noodles and vegetables.
