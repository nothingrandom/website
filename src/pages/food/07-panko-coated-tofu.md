intro: Noodles, tofu, breaded food - what's not to love!⁣

ingredients: [1 block of tofu, 2 limes, 60g panko breadcrumbs, 1 tbsp sesame seeds, ½ tsp salt, 35g flour, 1 egg ]
---
- Press your tofu for 30 minutes then cut into cubes.⁣
- Put the zest of the limes, the panko breadcrumbs, sesame seeds, and salt into a bowl and gently combine.⁣
- Put each piece of tofu into the flour, then the beaten egg, before the breadcrumb mixture (do this individually for the best results)⁣.
- Heat some oil on a medium heat in a deep frying pan, spread the tofu out when the oil is hot; turning regularly but carefully as to not disturb or break the breadcrumb covering. You're after a crisp, golden brown colour on all sides. If it goes black quickly, your pan is too hot.⁣
- Drain the completed tofu on some kitchen paper.⁣
- Server with a noodle or rice stir fry, dress with rice vinegar and lime juice to taste.⁣
