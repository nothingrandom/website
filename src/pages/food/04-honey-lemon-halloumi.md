intro: Halloumi is the one kind of dairy I'll still eat. Something about that salty, crispy, squeaky goodness is just irresistible.⁣⁣

ingredients: [340g brown rice (85g per person), 1 head of broccoli, 1 red pepper, 100g shiitake mushrooms, 1 medium red onion, 1 block of halloumi (200g), 1 tsp ginger, 2 garlic cloves, 2 tbsp honey, 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice (a conservative amount), salt and pepper]

- Start steaming your brown rice, 1:2 - rice:water, for roughly 30 minutes⁣ or until the water is evaporated.
- Whilst the rice is steaming, prep your broccoli into small florets (sometimes it's nice to parboil these for 3 minutes), red pepper into thin slices, half any large mushrooms, and finely chop the red onion.⁣
- Then prep your halloumi by cutting it into 1cm slices.⁣
- Fry your vegetables in a wok with some oil at a high temperature for roughly 5 minutes, then add the ginger and crush the garlic, continue frying for a further 5 minutes.⁣
- Meanwhile, start to fry the halloumi in a small amount of oil at a medium heat. Fry for 3 or 4 minutes on each side.⁣
- When the halloumi is done, place in a large bowl. Add the honey, lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Mix the halloumi up with the marinade, being careful not to break it up.
