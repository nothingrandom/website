intro: Tiny roast potatoes are one of my favourite new foods. I've been pairing this with nearly everything recently.

ingredients: [250g baby potatoes, oil, salt & pepper]
---
- Preheat the oven to 220°C⁣.
- Scrub your baby potatoes, remove any eyes, imperfections, discard any which are tiny or huge. You want them to all be a similar size.⁣
- Parboil them in slightly salted water for 5-7 minutes (just before they turn tender).⁣
- Place them into a roasting tray with a good glug of oil, salt, pepper, and some rosemary. Roast for 25-30 minutes.
