A refreshing weekend brunch / lunch. Poached eggs on grilled homemade bread with asparagus⁣. Asparagus is super simple to pan fry!⁣

A little oil (olive, sunflower, or coconut) and 5-7 minutes is all you need. The perfect side to any meal⁣.

And eggs are easy to poach as long as you put them into your boiling water one at a time and leave the yolks still runny. 2 minutes in salted boiling water, a splash of vinegar (if you have any around) helps hold them together but isn't even needed!⁣
