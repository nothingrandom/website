intro: Spag bol is great for a cold night, reheated the next day, or enjoyed just whenever you feel like it. One of my favourite things about this recipe is the flexability of it - switch up the vegetables as you desire.

ingredients:
  - bolognese: [50g dried green lentils, 15g dried porcini, 200g chestnut mushrooms, 1 red onion, 3 cloves garlic, 1 stick of celery, 1 carrot, 1 sprig of fresh rosemary, 1 bag leaf, 50ml red wine, 400g tin of tomatoes, 160g spaghetti]
  - breadcrumbs: [40g breadcrumbs, olive oil, 3 sprigs of thyme, salt & pepper]

- Wash the lentils in a suacepan, drain the water, cover with boiling water and simmer for 12 minutes. Drain, return to pan, and season with a little satle, pepper, and oil.
- Meanwhile, rehydrate the porcini by placing in a small bowl and just covering with boiling water.
- Dice the onion, crush the garlic, slice the mushrooms, and finely chop the celery and carrot. Pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves.
- Heat some olive oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat, add all the chopped veg, bay leaf, and rosemary, season, then cover with a lid and cook for 20 minutes. (Optionally, add some balsamic vinegar and sugar here)
- Turn the heat up to medium, pour in the red wine and cook away.
- Add the porcini (chop first if needed), along with the water - but leave any gritty bits out!
- Add the tin of tomatoes, and half a tin of water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 10+ minutes. Add then lenitls when ready.
- Cook the spaghetti according to instructions for al dente (normally 8 to 10 minutes in salted water). Reserve a mug of water when draining.
- Pick the thyme leaves, combine with breadcrumbs, a tablespoon of olive oil, salt and pepper. Then toast in a dry frying pan until golden and crisp.
- Remove the bay leaf, and add the reserved mug of pasta water to the sauce along with the spaghetti.
- Divide, top with the breadcrumbs, and tuck in.
