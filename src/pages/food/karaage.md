#### Marinate the protein:
- In a large mixing bowl combine the soy sauce, mirin, and rice wine.
- Pat dry the protein, and cut into bite sizes. Add to the marinade, mix, and leave for at least 2 hours, but best overnight in the fridge.

#### Frying method:
- Make a dry mix of cornflour and rice flour, 50/50.
- Heat the oil in a large saucepan.
- Coat the protein in the dry mix, and fry in batches of ~8 pieces, no overcrowding.
- You want a light golden colour, before draining onto kitchen towel or wire rack.
- After all the protein is fried, fry again in batches for a second time, until a deep golden brown.

Serve with sushi rice and steamed tenderstem broccoli. Enjoy!
