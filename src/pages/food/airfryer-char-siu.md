intro: Sometimes there's nothing better than takeaway style food at home. This is my recipe for air fryer char siu. It's got all the flavours I love; sweet, sticky, and a little charred.

ingredients: [1kg protein (such as tofu, chicken, or pork), 4 tbsp. hoisin sauce, 3 tbsp. granulated sugar, 2 tbsp. regular soy sauce, 1 tbsp. Shaoxing rice wine, 85g fermented red bean curd, 1½ tsp. teaspoons garlic powder, ½ tsp. teaspoon Chinese five spice powder, 2 tsp. red color (optional)]

#### Marinate the protein:
- In a large mixing bowl, add all the ingredients except the protein (hoisin sauce, sugar, soy sauce, rice wine, bean curd, food coloring, garlic powder, and five spice powder). Mix everything together and make sure to mash up the fermented bean curd well.
- Reserve about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the marinade for brushing. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
- Add the protein to the remaining marinade and mix well until it is evenly and well coated with the marinade. Cover and allow the protein to marinate for at least 1 hour but best overnight in the fridge.

#### Air frying method:
- Arrange the marinated protein in the basket in one even layer to promote even cooking. Avoid overlapping and overcrowding and cook in batches if needed. Optionally, save the leftover marinade for brushing.
*Also make sure to allow the excess marinade to drip off so that there's not a pool of marinade in the air fryer basket.*
- Air fry each batch of protein at 200°C for 10 minutes. Mid way through cooking, flip the protein and optionally brush on some leftover marinade to keep the protein moist.
- After air frying for 10 minutes, flip the protein once again and brush on the reserved marinade (from the very beginning). Make sure to use a clean brush. Air fry the protein for another 2 to 5 minutes, or until a desired amount of char develops on the protein.
- Remove the char siu protein from the air fryer and allow it to rest for 3 to 5 minutes before cutting. Repeat with remaining marinated protein if needed.

Serve with sushi rice and steamed tenderstem broccoli. Enjoy!
