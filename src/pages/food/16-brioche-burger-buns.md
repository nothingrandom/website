intro: I can say with strong certainty that this is one of the best lemon poppy seed cake recipes out there. It's sweet, moist, has that lemony tang, everything you look for in a lemon cake. This cake is also really simple, there's a fair margin on some of the ingredients as long as the dry to wet ratio is maintained, a little fiddly, but well worth your time.

ingredients:
  - tangzhong: [20g bread flour, 27g water, 60g whole milk]
  - dough: [120g whole milk, 9g instant yeast, 320g bread flour, 7g fine sea salt, 35g sugar, 1 whole egg, 1 egg yolk, 42g unsalted butter]
  - glaze: [1 whole egg, splash of oat milk]

- For the tangzhong, add all ingredients together over medium heat, and constantly whisk until it becomes a paste, a similar consistency to mashed potatoes
- Heat the milk to 30°C and add the yeast. Sit in a warm area for 8 minutes.
-  In a stand mixer bowl, add the dry ingredients. Slowly add in milk and yeast mixture then tangzhong mix. Let homogenize. - When dough starts coming together, add the egg and egg yolk. Then increase speed to medium low until incorporated.
- _Gradually_ add butter until incorporated, meaning when dough is mixed nothing sticks to the sides. 
- Lightly grease a medium sized bowl, gently shape and fold the dough and place seam side down. Cover with a damp towel, and proof for 1 – 1.5 hours in a warm area (an oven with the pilot light on works well in European weather).
- To shape use a dough scraper divide the dough into six even pieces around 95-105g. Where needed, use water to lightly moisten your work surfaces and hands, not flour.
- With moistened hands, gently stretch each ball and fold "triangles" to the center. Repeat this process making your way around the ball and flip so the folded seam is touching the work surface.
- Pull the dough ball towards you, creating tension on the surface of the ball and shaping it into a tight bun shape. Take care not to tear the surface, if this happens, set the ball aside, continue with the rest of the balls, and start shaping that dough again from the beginning after 20 minutes.
- Place shaped dough in baking tray lined with parchment paper. Leave 6 cm space between each bun.
- Cover for a further hour, with an upturned tray or a dampened towel.
- Before baking, brush with egg wash (1 whole egg plus a splash of milk).
- Bake at 190°C for 18 minutes until golden brown.
