intro: Sometimes you've got to make an impression with dinner guests. Nothing quite does it like these mushroom parcels. I serve them still bundled up, so that each person can pull on the string and discover the fresh, fragrant smell of wild mushrooms.⁣

ingredients: [200g button mushrooms, 300g mixed wild mushrooms, 2 tbsp sunflower or olive oil, 6 tbsp cream (I use soy cream), 3 tbsp red wine, 'fresh bunch of coriander, thyme, and rosemary', salt and pepper]

- Preheat the oven to 200°C⁣
- Place all the mushrooms into a mixing bowl breaking any of the large ones into halves or quarters.⁣
- In your mushroom mix, add the oil, cream, red wine, fresh herbs, and season to taste.
- Gently mix the ingredients together using your hands.
- Split the mix into 4 or 5 portions and place them into 35cm squares of baking paper, and bow them with butchers twine.⁣
- Cook in the oven for 17 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender.⁣
- Serve warm and whilst still wrapped, allowing each person to open their own parcel.⁣

This pairs nicely with a red or white wine, seasoned + steamed rice, and fresh beans.
