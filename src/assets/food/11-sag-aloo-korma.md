There's nothing a Brit loves more than a sweet, salty, and slightly spicy curry. This is a slightly healthier (and vegetarian) twist to the classic korma; that I've adapted from Jamie Oliver's [Super Food Family Classics](https://www.jamieoliver.com/family/jamies-super-food-family-classics/) book. It's easy to double, triple or even quadruple this recipe (the only limit being your pan size), so it's great for larger gatherings and parties. It's vegan, and if you make your own paste, guaranteed gluten free.

## Ingredients (serves 4)
- 500g potatoes
- 500g sweet potatoes
- olive oil
- 1 bunch of spring onions
- 500g spinach
- 1 400g tin of chickpeas
- 1 400ml tin of whole fat coconut milk
- 1 lemon
- 2 tbsp korma curry paste

### Korma Curry Paste:
- 2 tsp ground cumin seeds
- 1 tsp ground coriander seeds
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 2 cloves garlic
- 5cm piece of ginger
- 2 chillies (deseeded)
- 3 tbsp desiccated coconut
- 2 tbsp ground almonds
- juice of 1/2 a lemon
- 1 tbsp tomato puree
- small bunch of fresh coriander
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Method
- Make your korma curry paste by throwing all the ingredients into a blender, until you get a smooth paste. You only want 2 tbsp of it for this recipe, the rest will keep nicely in an egg box lined with clingfilm in the freezer (thanks Jamie!)
- Scrub the potatoes, and cut into bite sized chunks. Boil for 15 minutes, then set aside to dry.
- In a large frying pan, heat your oil then add the paste and the potatoes. Stir gently, browning the potatoes where you can.
- Add your sliced spring onions, and then your spinach in small batches leaving it to wilt each time.
- Pour in the tin of chickpeas (with the liquid), coconut milk, and ~100ml of water. Simmer on a low heat for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Serve with poppadoms, steamed brown rice, and a lemon wedge.
