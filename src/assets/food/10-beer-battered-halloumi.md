Growing up by the sea caused me to become a great lover of battered fish and chunky chips. I find the saltiness and texture of halloumi helps it pair with the chips and batter just as nicely as fish would. But honestly you could use this batter for anything; halloumi, tofu, or even fish!

## Ingredients (serves 4)
- 1 225g block of halloumi (tofu as a vegan / totally dairy free option)
- 125g self-raising flour, more for dusting (35g)
- 1-2 tbsp garam masala
- 330 ml beer
- salt and pepper to season
- frying oil (I use sunflower)
- 1 lemon, quartered

## Method
- Make your batter by mixing the flour, garam masala, beer, and salt and pepper. Whisk until it's a thick creamy consistency. If possible, leave in the fridge, covered, for tomorrow. Otherwise, set aside in the fridge for as long as possible, minimum of 30 minutes.
- Cut the block of halloumi into 9 or 10 slices. If you're using tofu, press for half an hour first.
- Heat enough oil in the bottom of a wok or small frying pan to cover the halloumi.
- Coat each piece of halloumi in the dusting flour, then the batter before placing it into the hot oil.
- You want a nice, crisp, golden batter. Turn the halloumi half way through. This will take a couple of minutes.
- Place each finished piece of halloumi onto a plate with kitchen towel to drain.
- Serve with a slice of lemon, oven chips, and some green veggies; peas, broccoli, or beans would work nicely
