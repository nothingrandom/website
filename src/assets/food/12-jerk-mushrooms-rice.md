Rice is a staple at our weekly community group. It's great for many reasons, it's easy to cook on bulk and it's also very versatile allowing me to experiment with different cuisines whilst knowing, worst case, the rice will still be edible.

Pair this with something great, like Jamaican style food and you're onto a winner. So many flavours, so tightly packaged. Each mouthful an explosion.

## Ingredients (serves 4)
- 340g brown rice
- 400g tin of kidney beans
- 200g of peas (frozen, tinned, or fresh)
- 200g of sweetcorn (frozen, tinned, or fresh)
- 400g mushrooms
- 1 large red onion
- 2-3 cloves of garlic
- Several large vine tomato
- 4 tbsp tomato puree
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 100ml coconut milk
- 1 fresh chili
- 1 tsp jerk seasoning (if you can't find this, a burrito seasoning could be used as a sub)
- 1 tsp teaspoon allspice
- 1 tsp teaspoon cumin powder
- 1 tsp teaspoon coriander powder
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 2 tsp desiccated coconut, to top
- Some fresh parsley, to top

## Method
- Cook the rice by the steam method (1 part rice, 2 parts water). Replace 100ml of the water with the coconut milk. Just before the rice is done, add half the kidney beans, the sweetcorn, and peas.
- Heat the coconut oil in a medium / large saucepan over mid heat. Sauté the chopped onion and crushed garlic until going transparent. Add the spices and mix in very well.
- Add the tomato puree, chopped tomatoes, chili, and vegetable stock with roughly 600ml of water. Continue on a medium heat, with the lid on, until most the liquid has evaporated and the sauce is getting thick - roughly 10 minutes.
- Add the mushrooms and other half of the tin of kidney beans, stir well, and put the lid back on the pot for 5 minutes. Take the lid off and cook to reduce the sauce again, because the mushrooms will have released liquid.
- Serve with the rice, and optionally some avocado, desiccated coconut and parsley.
