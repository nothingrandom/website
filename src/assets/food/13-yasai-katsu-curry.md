This dish is inspired by my regular order and Wagamama's. It's got a Japanese flair to it, but it's most certainly a British twist to the style of cuisine. This is a crowd pleaser, it's an easy dish, and even the kids will enjoy these veggies!

## Ingredients (serves 4)
### For the vegetables
- 2 sweet potatoes
- 1 aubergine
- 50g plain flour
- 1 egg
- 100g panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tbsp sesame seeds
- salt & pepper

### For the sauce
- 2 tbsp oil
- 1 large red onion
- 5 garlic cloves
- Thumb sized piece of ginger
- 2 medium carrots
- ½ Granny smith apple
- 1 tbsp white miso paste
- 4 tsp madras curry powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 4 tsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp rice vinegar
- 2 tsp mirin

## Method
- Fry the onion, diced, in a saucepan, until translucent. Add minced garlic and minced ginger, fry for a further few moments.
- Add peeled and sliced carrots and apple, madras powder, and garam masala. Stir and fry until the apple just starts to brown.
- Dissolve the miso pate in 1 cup of warm water and add to the saucepan.
- Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the carrot and apple has softened.
- Using either a stand-alone blender or stick blender, make a thick sauce. Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and mirin. Add more water if the sauce is too thick, but it shouldn't be too runny either.
- Cut the aubergine and sweet potato into ½cm slices.
- Place each slice of vegetables into the seasoned flour, then beaten egg, and finally the panko and sesame seed mixture.
- Shake each slice to remove excess breadcrumbs, then shallow fry in a wok or small frying pan for 2 minutes on each side. Drain on a plan with kitchen towel.
- Serve with steamed rice, green salad, and the curry sauce
