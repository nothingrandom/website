## Welkom bij Amsterdam! ðŸŒ·
Hey! This is my little guide to our home, it's brand new, missing stuff, and might be wrong or outdated. That's okay, you're probably either here with us or a lovely friend, house & pet sitting, who knows their way around. Think of this as more of a little reminder of this and that.

### The real important stuff
- The WiFi network is "The Hollow" and the password is "welkomthuis"
- Lock the front door, back doors, and gate if you're the last out

### Kitchen rules & info
- Please, please, please don't put the Tefal frying pans or any sharp kitchen knives in the dishwasher. Hand wash only! They'll last longer that way.
- You'll want to use the cooker hood / fan.
- I keep my knives sharp, the most dangerous thing in a kitchen is a blunt knife.
- The oven is super quiet. Make sure you turn it off, I often forget.
- Common sense, ya'know, try not to leave the fridge / freezer door open. That kinda stuff.

### Connected Home
We have a Google Chromecast, Google Home Mini, and Nest Thermostat.
The Chromecast is for the TV. It allows you to use your phone and it's native apps (Netflix, Spotify, YouTube), but show & play the content on the TV. There's also a Netflix button on the TV remote. So fancy.

The Google Home Mini is a mix between a speaker and Google Assisstant. If you find this creepy, just say, we're happy to have a conversation and decide if muting it is a good idea. If you're cat sitting for us, there's a switch on the back to mute (so you can still use the speaker function for Spotify). Otherwise just pull the power cable out, just let us know so I don't start shouting "Hey Google" in earnest.

The Nest Thermostat has some nice routines tied it, and it's linked to our phones. If we both leave, it'll go to Eco Mode (16 degrees), for example. It should use motion sensors to see if anyone is still in. Otherwise, feel free to turn the dial if it's too cold.

The shutters are on radio frequency remotes. There's three remotes because there's three shutters. One in the bedroom and two in the living room.

### Tosti

We feed Tosti wet food first thing in the morning, this is also the same time we top up her dry food. Sometimes she'll scoff the wet stuff up in 5 minutes, other times it'll still be half full mid-afternoon. Don't worry, she's funny like that. I struggle to remember a time she's ever finished all the wet and dry food in a day, so it doesn't need a same-day topup. Her water bowl might though!

Her litter box also gets scooped first thing in the morning. We change the litter 2 or 3 times a week, it varies, as does her bathroom routine. All normal.

### Area info
Our closest shops are in the Banne Centrum shopping center. They're a 10 minute walk or 5 minute cycle. There's quite a bit down there including a Lidl and a Plus (much nicer than Lidl). They close at 8pm, some earlier. There's another Plus which is open until 9pm. That's a 10 to 15 minute cycle depending on how dark it is and how lost you get.

We don't really do takeout that often. But Deliveroo and Thuisbezorgd are active in this neighbourhood, however there are limited choices on both services.
There are plenty of nice resturants around that don't do delivery. Some this side of the river, others on the south / central side.

If you're cat sitting you're welcome to use our Picnic account to get groceries delivered to the door. Just ask for the login details.
